# CTA Analysis Application
This console-based program uses Python3 and SQLite.\
When first run, the program will show basic statistics about the CTA2 daily ridership database.\
Then, the user will be able to input a command (1-9 or x to exit) with perhaps a bit more input to output some information about the database.

Note: The database file is too large to add.
